spacejam test-packages [options] [package...]
---------------------------------------------

[package...] can be a list of packages with tinytests or munit tests.
It enhances meteor test-packages, by supporting glob wildcards on package names
that are matched against all package names in the meteor app packages
directory.

If not specified, acts the same as meteor test-packages without arguments.

The following options are specific to spacejam:

--loglevel <level>

spacejam log level. One of trace|debug|info|warn|error. Defaults to info.

--root-url <url>

The meteor ROOT_URL. Defaults to http://localhost:--port/, and not ROOT_URL,
to avoid conflicts with your app's ROOT_URL.

--mongo-url <url>

The meteor MONGO_URL. Defaults to none, and not MONGO_URL,
to avoid conflicts with your app's MONGO_URL.

--phantomjs-options "<options...>"

The command line options to pass to phantomjs.
The default is: "--load-images=no --ssl-protocol=TLSv1".

--xunit-out <file>

If specified, saves results as xunit output to file.

--timeout  <milliseconds>

Total timeout for all tests. Defaults to no timeout.

The following options are meteor options and are passed through to meteor (all are optional):

--port <port>

The meteor port. Defaults to 4096, and not PORT, to avoid conflicts with your meteor app PORT.

--release <release>

The release of Meteor to use.

--settings <file>

Path to a meteor settings file.

--production

Simulate meteor production mode. Minify and bundle CSS and JS files.

--use-system-phantomjs

Use the installed version of PhantomJS instead of the one from the PhantomJS NPM package.

Running your package tests without a meteor app
